* fldare1161.nc -- raw output of flooded area for the first year of analysis in CaMa. Used to retrieve grid information.
control_outflw.mat, full_outflw.mat, physiology_outflw.mat, radiation_outflw.mat -- Matlab data structures containing annual maximum runoff at every point from CESM experiments. 
pyTfull.mat, pyTrad.mat, pyTphys.mat -- generated by GEVattempt1.ipynb. Return period of CTRL100 flood based on GEV fit. 
sig95.pkl -- mask of significance for each experiment, generated by GEV_1000bootstrap.ipynb
* cesm1_0_6.1850_4xco2_fulgb.1deg.002.clm2.MonthlyConcat_Meg.nc - Related CESM variables in FULL experiment from the land model (monthly). 
validGridMask_CaMa.ma -- land/ocean mask at CaMa resolution
CaMa_gridAreas.mat    -- grid areas of CaMa resolution
* MonthlyAverages.pkl   -- Monthly average river discharge (created initially/used in RiverAnalysis.ipynb)
lonIndices_subsetKey.txt, latIndices_subsetKey.txt -- indices of gridcells with a "river" - defined as gridcells with average discharge over 500 m3/s (see section at end of RiverAnalysis notebook for illustration). 
* Control_outflow_subset.nc, Full_outflow_subset.nc Physiology_outflow_subset.nc, Radiation_outflow_subset.nc -- raw outflow from CaMa corresponding to "river" locations as defined by lonIndices and latIndices above. 
BasinMask.mat -- definitions of individual basins
BasinMask_CESMres.mat -- definitions of individual basins at CESM resolution 
* StreamflowAnnualExtremes.pkl -- percentages, max, min, and mean river discharges 


Scripts:
GEV_1000bootstrap.ipynb      -- Compute 1000 member bootstrap of GEV fit and determine significant changes of CTRL100 flood frequency. Create mask of drivers.This program is responsible for creating Figure 1, with the exception of resizing individual panels and added text labels, which were done in Adobe Illustrator. 
RiverAnalysis.ipynb          -- Define peak and low flows globally. Creates data that gets used in Fig. 2.
Figures_Jul17.ipynb          -- Create top panels of Fig. 2.     
Streamflow_PatternCorr.ipynb -- Create latitudinal plots of streamflow, as in bottom panels of Fig. 2. 
LinearityAnalysis.ipynb      -- Basin-level analysis of streamflow changes. Creates Fig. 3. 
GRDC_validation.ipynb        -- Creates Fig. 4.
